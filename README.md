# Hey, I'm Vie! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» **Software Engineer** 

Hi, Iâ€™m Vie (/vi/). Iâ€™m passionate about building web experiences that are accessible, inclusive, and impactful. With a background as a licensed massage therapist, I bring a unique attention to detail and care to every project, focusing on creating user-centered designs that foster connection. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on expanding my expertise in backend development and database integration. I also leverage AI tools like ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, streamline workflows, and create detailed README.md files with a focus on usage and testing. My goal is to create technology that not only functions smoothly but also leaves a positive, lasting impact.
